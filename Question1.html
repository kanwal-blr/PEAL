Find the value of k and m : ( 3 ^3n+2 + 3^3n-1 ) / ( 2*3^nk) = m. n>0 and m is a constant

To find the values of $k$ and $m$, we need to simplify the given expression and ensure that the result $m$ is independent of the variable $n$.

The given equation is:
$$ \frac{3^{3n+2} + 3^{3n-1}}{2 \cdot 3^{nk}} = m $$

**Step 1: Simplify the numerator.**
We can factor out the smallest power of 3 from the terms in the numerator, which is $3^{3n-1}$.

$$ 3^{3n+2} + 3^{3n-1} = 3^{3n-1} \cdot 3^3 + 3^{3n-1} \cdot 1 $$
$$ = 3^{3n-1} (3^3 + 1) $$
$$ = 3^{3n-1} (27 + 1) $$
$$ = 28 \cdot 3^{3n-1} $$

**Step 2: Substitute the simplified numerator back into the original equation.**
$$ \frac{28 \cdot 3^{3n-1}}{2 \cdot 3^{nk}} = m $$

**Step 3: Simplify the fraction.**
Divide the coefficients ($28/2$) and combine the powers of 3 using the exponent rule $\frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}$.

$$ 14 \cdot \frac{3^{3n-1}}{3^{nk}} = m $$
$$ 14 \cdot 3^{(3n-1) - nk} = m $$

Group the terms containing $n$ in the exponent:
$$ 14 \cdot 3^{n(3-k) - 1} = m $$

**Step 4: Solve for $k$.**
The problem states that $m$ is a **constant**. This means the value of $m$ cannot change as $n$ changes. For the expression on the left side to be constant, the exponent of 3 must not depend on $n$.

Therefore, the coefficient of $n$ in the exponent must be zero:
$$ 3 - k = 0 $$
$$ k = 3 $$

**Step 5: Solve for $m$.**
Now that we know $k=3$, substitute this value back into the simplified equation to find $m$.

$$ m = 14 \cdot 3^{n(3-3) - 1} $$
$$ m = 14 \cdot 3^{0 - 1} $$
$$ m = 14 \cdot 3^{-1} $$
$$ m = \frac{14}{3} $$

**Answer:**
$$ k = 3 $$
$$ m = \frac{14}{3} $$
